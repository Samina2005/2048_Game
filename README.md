## About

2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

## Features

- Classic 4x4 grid (configurable)
- Slide tiles using arrow keys or swipe gestures (if on mobile)
- Merge tiles with the same number to form larger numbers
- Score tracking
- Undo (optional)
- Animations and responsive layout (optional)


## Controls / How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓) to move the tiles.
- On mobile, swipe left / up / right / down.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two.
- Each move adds a new tile with value 2 (or sometimes 4).
- The game ends when there are no legal moves left.
- The goal is to create a tile with the value 2048 — but you can continue playing to reach higher scores.



## Configuration

- Grid size: default 4x4 (if supported, explain how to change)
- Starting tiles value or probability for 2 vs 4 (if configurable)
